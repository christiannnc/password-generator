# Password Generator
This program asks the user for a password length, then randomly generates a "strong" password
of that length for the user. This program requires that the user enters a length greater than 12
characters, but less than 112 characters.

## Security
This program is extremely simple and not necessarily secure.
Much more logic could be added to ensure things like repetitive characters
and missing requirements are prevented, but this a good basic password generator
